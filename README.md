# üèçÔ∏è Motorcycle Price Prediction Model

Welcome to the **Motorcycle Price Prediction Model** project! This project is designed to predict the prices of motorcycles using machine learning techniques. The model is built using Python and its powerful libraries such as Pandas and Scikit-learn. This project was created for a Kaggle assessment challenge.

## üìú Introduction

This project aims to predict the prices of motorcycles based on various features such as brand, model, type, and other specifications. The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle and contains comprehensive information about different motorcycle models and their corresponding prices.

> **Note:** In this project, we didn't check for null values because the dataset is from Kaggle, and this check has already been performed in another step. However, if you want to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), you can include this step to ensure data quality.

> **Note:** In this Project,I didn't add the generated model because it was more than 25 mb because the algo I use is not so good and this project was for learning

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/motorcycle-price-prediction.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd motorcycle-price-prediction
    ```

3. Install the required packages using Pip
## üìä Data

The dataset is divided into two parts:

- `train.csv`: Contains the training data with motorcycle features and their corresponding prices.
- `test.csv`: Contains the test data for which you need to predict the prices.

Here is a preview of the data structure:

| Column Name    | Description                      |
|----------------|----------------------------------|
| `id`           | Unique identifier for each record|
| `brand`        | Brand of the motorcycle          |
| `model`        | Model name                       |
| `model_year`   | Year of manufacture              |
| `milage`       | Mileage of the motorcycle        |
| `fuel_type`    | Type of fuel used                |
| `engine`       | Engine specifications            |
| `transmission` | Type of transmission             |
| `ext_col`      | Exterior color                   |
| `int_col`      | Interior color                   |
| `accident`     | Number of accidents reported     |
| `clean_title`  | Whether the title is clean       |
| `price`        | Price of the motorcycle (target variable) |

## ü§ñ Model

The prediction model is built using the following steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handling missing values
   - Encoding categorical variables
   - Feature scaling

2. **Model Training**:
   - Splitting the data into training and validation sets
   - Training a regression model using Scikit-learn (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest)

3. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Evaluating the model's performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

## üìà Evaluation

The performance of the model is evaluated using the following metrics:

| Metric | Description                         |
|--------|-------------------------------------|
| `MAE`  | Mean Absolute Error                 |
| `RMSE` | Root Mean Squared Error             |

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

To use the model for predicting motorcycle prices, follow these steps:

1. Open the Jupyter notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook notebooks/motorcycle_price_prediction.ipynb
    ```

2. Run all the cells to execute the entire workflow, from data preprocessing to model evaluation.

3. Load your test data and use the trained model to make predictions.
